# Welcome to a new workshop!

Welcome to a new workshop in which the goal will be to make a "fake" discord along with "fake" bots. We can get started!

## Goal

The goal of this workshop is to create a "fake" discord and fake bots in order to interact with them.


## Why?

It can be useful if you'd like to give a preview of a bot. For example, the bot called MEE6, if you know it has such a feature. This is where the inspiration comes from!

# Project

Duration: 2h30
Language: Js/HTML

We're cool, so the css is already given to you as an early christmas gift. There is no server to create, everything will happen locally


### Step 1

Create a code in html that has a text field and where it is possible to add some text inside it. Next up add a "send" button.

### Step 2

Put the text field at the bottom of your page

### Step 3

Create a js script that makes it possible to send a message on the website itself.

### Step 3 bis

Edit the html code so there are 3 channels created. Here are the names:

```
#lem-in
#panoramix
#sbml-parser
```

Next up, add a message on the top of the channel that says "Heya, welcome to the awesome bot testing".

### Step 4

Edit that script so it specifies a username of the sender with a user avatar (any you want)

### Step 5

Make it possible so when writing !help, a bot answers with this:

"Ah yes, yes, I'm awake, I'm a super bot" (Panoramix <3)

### Step 6

Make it possible so when doing `!create {channel}` it creates a new channel on the website. Doing `!create zappy` creates a new channel called zappy.

### Step 7

Make it possible so when doing `!delete {channel}` it deletes the channel that was mentioned. It should work only for created channels, deleting default channels isn't necessarily needed.
